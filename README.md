# Obsidian Starter Kit
All the Obsidian Themes and Plugins I need, each time I create a new vault.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) has become an indispensable tool in many of my workflows, but every time I create a new vault I waste a lot of time downloading the additional plugins and themes I need and calibrating everything, so I decided to create this repository, hoping it will save me and anyone else interested some time.

When you first open it you will be asked if you want to update third-party plugins, and you can do that safely because I only implement very reliable themes and plugins.

Of course, the versions included through the repository may be outdated and you will have to update everything.

This repository is released under an MIT license, but Obsidian, the themes and plugins included in this repository belong to their rightful owners and are distributed through their licenses.
